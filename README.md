[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cgs-ets/moodle-block_my_day_buttons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cgs-ets/moodle-block_my_day_buttons)

A custom responsive block visible to Primary School students on the site home and to staff and parents on primary studnet profiles.
The block displays the student's courses as buttons with the course image. At CGS, this normally consists of two buttons, one for their main class and one for their year level course. 
The right hand side displays any specialist classes/activities for the current day. This is fed from the school's SIS (Synergetic).
